    "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) by achieving remarkable performance in various tasks. However, it is challenging to align these models with human preferences. Therefore, the direct preference optimization (DPO) method comes in place which directly optimizes LLMs based models on user preferences, enhancing their alignment with human expectations. In this hands-on lab, you'll use the transformer reinforcement learning (trl) library from Hugging Face to implement DPO and fine-tune LLMs.\n",

Make drawing a part of your daily routine.\\n2. Set a specific duration: Determine the amount of time you want to spend on drawing each day. It can be as little as 10 minutes or as long as an hour. Be consistent with the duration to help build the habit.\\n3. Start small and simple: Don't try to create a masterpiece every day, start with simple and easy-to-do sketches. Focus on improving your skills gradually.\\n4. Use a variety of tools and mediums: Experiment with different tools like pencils, pens, markers, and different mediums like paper, canvas, or digital apps to keep your drawing practice interesting and engaging.\\n5. Take breaks and rest: Taking breaks and resting after some time of drawing can help you avoid burnout and stay motivated.\\n6. Challenge yourself: Set challenges like drawing objects from memory or a specific subject to improve your skills and keep your drawing practice interesting.\\n7. Track your progress: Keep a record of your daily drawing practice and track your progress.
